A dictionary in Python is a versatile data structure that stores key-value pairs. It allows you to associate a unique key with a corresponding value, enabling efficient data retrieval. Dictionaries are enclosed in curly braces and consist of key-value pairs separated by colons. They are mutable, meaning you can add, modify, or remove entries dynamically. Python dictionaries are commonly used for tasks like indexing, counting, and storing configuration settings due to their fast lookup capabilities.
